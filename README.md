# Bluetooth-Control-Door-Lock
# First Hands On Project on Arduino 
# June 2018

As thefts are increasing day by day security is becoming a major concern nowadays. 
In this project we will make a digital door lock system with keypad using Arduino Uno.
 It will open your door only when the right password is entered and it will start beeping when a wrong password is entered.
Programming is done using Arduino Software in modified embedded C language.
Instructions are provided through Bluetooth Connectivity with smart devices.
Door lock is unlocked using Servo Motor connected to mechanical lock.
